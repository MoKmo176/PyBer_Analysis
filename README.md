## Overview of PyBer Analysis

### Purpose
This analysis of PyBer Ride Sharing App is to analyze customer data to better understand the market for ride sharing services.   The most important segementation in this analysis is the the "type" of markets, which include: urban, suburban, and rural. The dataset focuses on Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, as well as their average fares per Ride and per Driver.

## Results and Analysis 


Total Fare by City Types is highest in Urban areas, yet the Average Fare per Driver is the lowest. Since there is less area in the Urban landscape, it is evident that drivers in Suburban city types can collect more Fare per Ride and can obtain higher earning potential in the Fare per Driver category.

Suburban and Rural Average Fare Per Ride is very similar, but Total Fares between Suburban and Rural are significantly disparate. While Urban city types have the highest total fare, the earning potential of a driver in the Urban city category is less per ride.

## Summary

After reviewing the disparities by city types please see the following recommendations: 

1. Incentivize Urban drivers to take on Suburban routes, this will bring in more Fare per driver and solve overcrowding in the market for Urban drivers. 
2. Rural Fares are much higher only because of sheer volume, lowering Rural fare prices might see an influx of new passengers and ultimately more drivers. 
3. Create more strict restrictions for drivers in Urban areas, this should be to increase overall safety and satisfaction, as well as to systematically increase prices in Urban city types, the Average Fare Per Driver will increase allowing more earning potential.
